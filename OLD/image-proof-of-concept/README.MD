A dockerfile containing the necessary commands to do things. 

General resources 

Tools that wont come prepackaged with whatever I base the image off of

kubectl

yq (used in step 6)

Still TODO
How do I set this up such that kubectl will have permissions to act on every namespace? (just deploy it in said namespace)

Use the entries in cronjob-stuff to get any information. 

Thought a bit about using makefile but don't think it suits my purpose here.

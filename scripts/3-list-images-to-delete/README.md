STEP 3

Create a json of `images-to-delete` whose contents are from `image-list.json` minus `keep-images.json`.
Where again hopefully the `path` from `image-list.json` will match up nicecly with the names provided by `keep-images.json`(kubectl)

JSON contains repo, path (hoping something like: jupyterlab/dee04931), and name (manifest.json)

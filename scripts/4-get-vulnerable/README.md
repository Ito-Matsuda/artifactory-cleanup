STEP 4

Not sure how to get this running / scan for vulnerable images (xray?)
Then would need to get information on who is using that image and then sending some notif?

I am also guessing that we will have scanning as a part of our CI/CD process. So perhaps this is ran on the older images.
So again would use the output form 1-all-old-images and use the paths there to scan everything in that 'image' folder (ie the docker layers)
